  desc_hr_counter_reformation:0 "Local circumstances in the predominantly Catholic regions of Italy and Iberia, such as the already-established presence of the Spanish Inquisition in Iberia, and the close geographical and religious ties to the Holy See in Italy, have made it exceptionally difficult for the Reformation and its ideas to gain a foothold in these parts of Europe."

  historicalai.1.desc:0 "The attempted reformation of the Catholic Church is spreading across Europe like wildfire. From Lisbon to Stockholm, practices and teachings of the Church are facing increasing dissent, both internal and external in origin. While many discontent Catholics have flocked to this growing movement, the followers of reformers such as Martin Luther and John Calvin have faced harsh persecution in most parts of Italy and Iberia, from the clergy, nobility, and zealous commoners alike. As such, it has become apparent that the Reformation is unlikely to succeed in these parts of Europe."
