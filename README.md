# Historical-Project-Mod
HPM for EU4
A rework of several features of Europa Universalis IV to be more historically accurate.

In Progress
-----------
Reformation Rework
  * Historical spread of reformation
  * AI countries will embrace their historical religions
  * Orthodoxy is more resilient and will not disappear at the hands of the Polish or Lithuanians
  * Catholicism is more resilient
  * Protestantism will primarily spread in Northern Europe, such as Northern Germany and Scandinavia
  * Switzerland, Netherlands, and Scotland will embrace the Reformed religion
  * More flavor events
  
Planned
-------
Colonization Rework
  * Colonial nations will convert Native religions and cultures
  * Colonial powers will colonize areas they colonized historically (i.e. Spain colonizes Peru, Mexico, Colombia, while England colonizes America and Canada)
  * Colonial nations will not colonize outside of their colonial region
  * Certain colonial nations will be nerfed to prevent the rapid spread and colonization of the entire world.
  * Certain African provinces will be made uncolonizable
  * Non-European nations will no longer colonize

Configuration Options
  * Players will be greeted with a start event upon the launch of the mod that will allow them to configure certain aspects of the mod and disable certain features

Primarily, these changes will impact the AI rather than the player. Player choice will be upheld.
